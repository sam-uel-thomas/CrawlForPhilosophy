# Wiki Philosophy Route Finder

This is a frontend application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), designed to interact with a custom API that finds a route to Philosophy from any Wikipedia page.

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally:

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm install` to install all required dependencies
3. `npm run dev` to start the local server

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application in action.

## Usage

Start by entering a Wikipedia page title into the search bar. The application will then find and display a route to the Philosophy page on Wikipedia.

## Project Structure

The main file you'll interact with is `app/page.js`. This is where the main application logic resides. The application uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
